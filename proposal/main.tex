\title{Crosshatch: A Web Application for Crossword Collaboration}

\section{Motivation and Vision}
\label{mot}
When doing a crossword puzzle from a physical newspaper, it is easy for a few people to gather around and work on solving it together.
This is because all of the clues are visible at once, so each person can scan around for clues they know the answer to. However, this technique
for crossword collaboration does not extend well into the digital world. Most major websites that host interactive crosswords only show a small subset of
clues (e.g. The LA Times \cite{latcrossword}) at a time, forcing all collaborators to focus on the same small portion of the clues. In the authors' personal experience,
this is an inferior way to collaborate on a crossword: a lot of the fun of joint crosswords is rapidly going back and forth in different areas
of the grid, calling out newly discovered answers.

To solve this problem, this paper proposes Crosshatch: a web application for crossword collaboration. Crosshatch will
allow multiple participants to work on the \textit{same} crossword from their own personal devices (in a way similar to document-sharing services,
but for crosswords instead of general documents). To make finding and solving crosswords easy, Crosshatch will provide access to multiple free daily crosswords
from around the US (LA Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, etc.) and feature a convenient user interface for solving.

The ultimate aim of Crosshatch is to provide a crossword collaboration experience that is superior to all other online options.
% enjoyment of crosswords
% crosswords are really fun to do together!
% this is easy in a paper newspaper, but really hard online since only one clue displays at once
% (paper newspaper does not scale to large amounts of people)

\section{Proposed Work}
Expanding on the overarching vision expressed in Section \ref{mot}, the aim of the Crosshatch web application is to provide the following
specific features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item A convenient UI for interacting with and solving a crossword puzzle in a web browser
  \item The ability for multiple people (at least three) to interact with the same crossword puzzle at the same time from different devices
  \item Daily crossword ingestion from at least one popular free source (LA Times, Wall Street Journal, USA Today, etc.)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Architecture}

In order to execute on the goals of this project, there are multiple important architecture and design decisions that must be made.
Since Crosshatch
is a web application, an immediate crossroads is the choice of web libraries. Vue and FastAPI have been chosen
as initial options for frontend and backend libraries respectively, but are subject to change. Sections \ref{vue}
and \ref{fastapi} explain the reasoning behind these choices.
More fundamental than these choices though, is the choice of architecture for the collaboration feature. There are two primary
options for this, which are explored in Section \ref{collabarch}. Finally, there is a discussion of crossword data ingestion in
Section \ref{ingestarch}

\subsubsection{Vue}
\label{vue}

\subsubsection{FastAPI}
\label{fastapi}

\subsubsection{Collaboration}
\label{collabarch}

\subsubsection{Data Ingestion}
\label{ingestarch}
% vue frontend (we want to try something growing and new because it seems interesting)
% fastapi framework (simple and fast, in python)
% we are flexible on these choices

% two possible architectures
% (1) host frontend holds crossword ground truth
% (2) backend holds crossword ground truth
% leaning towards (2) since this allows session pauses

% data ingestion (we know its possible since there are many 3rd party crossword apps)

% explain idea in detail

\subsection{Deliverables}
There are three concrete deliverables for the proposed project:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The entire source code for Crosshatch
  \item A final report explaining the design and implementation of Crosshatch
  \item A comprehensive demo of the final working web application
\end{itemize}
% source code
% final report explaining final design and implementation
% demo of working product

\section{Timeline}
% research ways/architectures to connect clients together into a shared crossword session
% research ways to ingest daily crosswords
% implementation
% - create UI
% - set up crossword ingestion
% - set up connections between clients and any necessary databases (ground truth)
% - evaluate different methods of rectifying conflicting edits
% - investigate scalability (stretch goal: many people working on a huge crossword puzzle)
% finalize source code and testing
% create presentation and final report

\subsection{Stretch Goals and Future Work}
% - expand to sudoku
% - ...
