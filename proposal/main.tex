\title{Crosshatch: A Web Application for Crossword Collaboration}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\section{Motivation and Vision}
% enjoyment of crosswords
% crosswords are really fun to do together!
% this is easy in a paper newspaper, but really hard online since only one clue displays at once
% (paper newspaper does not scale to large amounts of people)
\subsection{Related Work}
% - paper on collaborative editing. mention how our case is simpler

\section{Proposed Work}
\subsection{System Architecture}
% vue frontend (we want to try something growing and new because it seems interesting)
% fastapi framework (simple and fast, in python)
% we are flexible on these choices

% two possible architectures
% (1) host frontend holds crossword ground truth
% (2) backend holds crossword ground truth
% leaning towards (2) since this allows session pauses

% data ingestion (we know its possible since there are many 3rd party crossword apps)

% explain idea in detail

\subsection{Deliverables}
% source code
% final report explaining final design and implementation
% demo of working product

\section{Timeline}
% research ways/architectures to connect clients together into a shared crossword session
% research ways to ingest daily crosswords
% implementation
% - create UI
% - set up crossword ingestion
% - set up connections between clients and any necessary databases (ground truth)
% - evaluate different methods of rectifying conflicting edits
% - investigate scalability (stretch goal: many people working on a huge crossword puzzle)
% finalize source code and testing
% create presentation and final report

\subsection{Stretch Goals and Future Work}
% - expand to sudoku
% - ...
